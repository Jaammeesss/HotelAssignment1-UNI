# Description 

This is the first website that i had ever built, it was during my first year of Computer Science at UEA, and it achieved me the Grade of 2.1 when i handed it in for submission, i had never coded properly before doing this piece of coursework. This was fundementally what made me choose the career path that i have taken.
